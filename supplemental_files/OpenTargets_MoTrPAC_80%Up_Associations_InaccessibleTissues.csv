Symptoms include episodes of abdominal pain, recurrent inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis), abnormal enlargement of the liver and/or spleen (hepatosplenomegaly), and the development of skin lesions known as erruptive xanthomas. Familial lipoprotein lipase deficiency is caused by changes (mutations) in the LPL gene. It is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern.

It is mainly found in females and is characterized by small or poorly developed eyes (microphthalmia) and characteristic linear skin markings on the head and neck. The signs and symptoms of this condition may include abnormalities of the brain, heart, and genitourinary system. Other symptoms may include short stature, developmental delay, and finger and toenails that do not grow normally (nail dystrophy). MLS syndrome is typically caused by either a deletion of certain genetic material on the p (short) arm of the X chromosome or by a mutation in the HCCS gene. In some cases, it may be caused by mutations in the COX7B and NDUFB11 genes, (also located on the X chromosome). According to the mutated gene, the disease may be classified in three subtypes. This condition is inherited in an X-linked manner and is thought to result in serious early developmental concerns in males, leading to almost no males with this condition surviving to delivery.Although there is no specific treatment or cure for MLS syndrome, there may be ways to manage the symptoms.
