Symptoms include episodes of abdominal pain, recurrent inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis), abnormal enlargement of the liver and/or spleen (hepatosplenomegaly), and the development of skin lesions known as erruptive xanthomas. Familial lipoprotein lipase deficiency is caused by changes (mutations) in the LPL gene. It is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern.

This condition usually presents with itching (especially on the lower legs) and visible changes of skin hyperpigmentation and thickening that may be exacerbated by chronic scratching and rubbing. Primary localized cutaneous amyloidosis is often divided into macular and lichen subtypes although many affected individuals often show both variants coexisting. Lichen amyloidosis characteristically presents as a pruritic eruption of grouped hyperkeratotic papules with a predilection for the shins, calves, ankles and dorsa of feet and thighs. Papules may coalesce to form hyperkeratotic plaques that can resemble lichen planus, lichen simplex or nodular prurigo. Macular amyloidosis is characterized by small pigmented macules that may merge to produce macular hyperpigmentation, sometimes with a reticulate or rippled pattern. In macular and lichen amyloidosis, amyloid is deposited in the papillary dermis in association with grouped colloid bodies, thought to represent degenerate basal keratinocytes. The amyloid deposits probably reflect a combination of degenerate keratin filaments, serum amyloid P component, and deposition of immunoglobulins. PLCA3 inheritance is autosomal recessive.

Amyloidosis cutis dyschromia is a rare primary cutaneous amyloidosis characterized by macular or reticulate hyperpigmentation with symmetrically distributed guttate hypo- and hyperpigmented lesions which progress gradually over the years to involve almost the entire body (with relative sparing of the face, hands, feet and neck). Patients are usually asymptomatic, however mild pruritus may be associated. Amyloid deposition in the papillary dermis is observed on skin biopsy. Systemic amyloidosis is not present and association with generalized morphea, atypical Parkinsonism, spasticity, motor weakness or colon carcinoma is rare. [Orphanet_319635]",ENSG00000136235

It is predominantly a disease of older white women of northern European extraction, but it is seen in all ages and ethnic groups. Adenocarcinomas constitute the vast majority of ovarian carcinomas. The pattern of metastatic spread in ovarian carcinoma is similar regardless of the microscopic type. The most common sites of involvement are the contralateral ovary, peritoneal cavity, para-aortic and pelvic lymph nodes, and liver. Lung and pleura are the most common sites of extra-abdominal spread. The primary form of therapy is surgical. The overall prognosis of ovarian carcinoma remains poor, a direct result of its rapid growth rate and the lack of early symptoms. --2002",ENSG00000041880

This complex is important for the activation of the complement system (a group of proteins that work with the immune system). It also disposes cells that are dead. C1q deficiency presents in 2 different forms, absent C1q protein or abnormal C1q protein. Symptoms include infections (ear infections (otitis media), meningitis, urinary tract infections, oral infections); skin lesions (small blisters (vesicles), dark patches, and atrophic areas) that get worse upon light exposure; cataracts; loss of eyelashes, eyebrows, and scalp hair; blood in urine; and glomerulonephritis. About 93% of cases are associated with systemic lupus erythematosus. It can be caused by mutations in the C1QA, C1QB or C1QC genes and is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern.

It has also been associated with a kidney disease known as mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis. C1q is a complex and together with other proteins, C1r and C1s, it forms the C1 complex. This complex is important for the activation of the complement system (a group of proteins that work with the immune system). It also disposes cells that are dead. C1q deficiency presents in 2 different forms, absent C1q protein or abnormal C1q protein. Symptoms include infections (ear infections (otitis media), meningitis, urinary tract infections, oral infections); skin lesions (small blisters (vesicles), dark patches, and atrophic areas) that get worse upon light exposure; cataracts; loss of eyelashes, eyebrows, and scalp hair; blood in urine; and glomerulonephritis. About 93% of cases are associated with systemic lupus erythematosus. It can be caused by mutations in the C1QA, C1QB or C1QC genes and is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. Treatment depends on the symptoms. Recently, it was shown that C1q production can be restored by allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, a procedure in which a person receives blood-forming stem cells (cells from which all blood cells develop) from a genetically similar, but not identical donor.",ENSG00000173372

It differs significantly from arthritis commonly seen in adults (osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis), and other types of arthritis that can present in childhood which are chronic conditions (e.g. psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis).

Grossly, hepatocellular carcinoma may present as a single mass, as multiple nodules, or as diffuse liver involvement. Microscopically, there is a wide range of differentiation from tumor to tumor (well differentiated to poorly differentiated tumors).

The disorders differ in terms of the distribution and extent of muscle weakness (some forms of MD also affect cardiac muscle), age of onset, rate of progression, and pattern of inheritance. The prognosis for people with MD varies according to the type and progression of the disorder. There is no specific treatment to stop or reverse any form of MD. Treatment is supportive and may include physical therapy, respiratory therapy, speech therapy, orthopedic appliances used for support, corrective orthopedic surgery, and medicationsincluding corticosteroids, anticonvulsants (seizure medications), immunosuppressants, and antibiotics.

Hepatocellular carcinoma is more common in males than females and is associated with hepatitis B, hepatitis C, chronic alcohol abuse and cirrhosis. Serum elevation of alpha-fetoprotein occurs in a large percentage of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. Grossly, hepatocellular carcinoma may present as a single mass, as multiple nodules, or as diffuse liver involvement. Microscopically, there is a wide range of differentiation from tumor to tumor (well differentiated to poorly differentiated tumors). Hepatocellular carcinomas quickly metastasize to regional lymph nodes and lung. The overall median survival of untreated liver cell carcinoma is about 4 months.

The short stature is the result of unusually short forearms and forelegs (mesomelia) and abnormal shortening of the bones in the hands and feet (acromelia). At birth, the hands and feet may appear abnormally short and broad. Over time, the apparent disproportion becomes even more obvious, especially during the first years of life. Additional features may include: limited extension of the elbows and arms; progressive abnormal curvature of the spine; an enlarged head; and a slightly flattened midface. Acromesomelic dysplasia is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. There are different types of acromesomelic dysplasia, which are distinguished by their genetic cause.

Microscopically, there is a wide range of differentiation from tumor to tumor (well differentiated to poorly differentiated tumors).
