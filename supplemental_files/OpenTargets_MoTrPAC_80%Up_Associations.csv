Symptoms include episodes of abdominal pain, recurrent inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis), abnormal enlargement of the liver and/or spleen (hepatosplenomegaly), and the development of skin lesions known as erruptive xanthomas. Familial lipoprotein lipase deficiency is caused by changes (mutations) in the LPL gene. It is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern.
